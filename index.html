        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            A user opens a browser on their computer such as Firefox and requests information
            from a URL such as <a href="http://WWW.Udacity.com">Udacity.com.</a>  The set of rules used to traverse the world wide web is called <span class="bold">HTTP</span> or <span class="italic">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</span> and the information sought might be a webpage containing text, videos, images etc. The webpage displayed is written in a language the computer understands called <span class="bold">HTML</span> or <span class="italic">Hypertext Markup Language</span>
            <span class="bold">HTTP</span> finds the <span class="bold">HTML</span> document on the correct server (another type of computer that
            stores information) and sends it back where the browser
            interprets and displays
            the information on the user's screen.

          <p>
            Programmers have to be smart because computers are stupid!  Programmers must write code in the correct syntax because computers translate the code literally; this can be frustrating but with extreme focus--powerful. Programmers are smarter than computers but they cannot remember all the rules!  If you forget a rule--just look it up!

            In programming language there are <span class="bold">tag, element</span>  and <span class="bold">attribute</span>definitions and rules.  In HTML, the <span class="bold">text</span> is <span class="italic">what you see</span> and the <span class="bold">markup</span> is <span class="italic">what it looks like.</span> A tag was used in the previous sentence to make the letters in the word "text" and "markup" appear <span class="bold">bold</span>; it requires an opening tag and a closing tag to create the appearance.  The word "text" is called the <span class="bold">content</span>  and the entire length of this information end to end is called an <span class="bold">element.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            As mentioned there are <span class="bold">attributes</span> within elements.  You can look them up on the internet but let me share another example here because <span class="bold">coding is fun!</span> Some tags require an "attribute" like the "img" tag requires an opening tag, an attribute: "src", a link to the image, an "alt" attribute containing text to desribe the image; this is for two reasons 1) in case the link is broken and 2) for the blind.  What no closing tag?  "img" is a <span class="bold">void</span>  tag; and therefore, does not require a closing tag.

          <p>
            HTML and <span class="bold">CSS</span> Cascading Style Sheets are two of the many languages used to create web pages.  HTML develops the classification or structure and CSS provides the style or look and feel of a web page.  When programmers talk about <span class="bold">DOM</span> Document Object Model, they are talking about the <span class="italic">tree-like</span> structure of a web page. Beginner web page developers should start with big boxes, move to small boxes and literally sketch out their web design with a pen or pencil. Programmers define boxes or containers around their content with <span class="bold">div</span> tags. The <span class="bold">div</span> tag is one of the most important tags used to organize HTML into big and small boxes needed to organize and structure HTML. They use "span" and other tags to help with the styling of their content.

Sublime anticipates the tag you need with a pop-up selection box triggered by one or two key-strokes.

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            Programmers use CSS to add style to their HTML structure by
            using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS Reference.</a> Programmers learn possible values and properties of attributes they need to convert their mockup to code. <span class="bold">Cascading</span> means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' children. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.

          The Box Model and Avoiding Repetition with CSS

          <p>
            Programmers define boxes around their content with "div" tags but its important to remember to use standards. Using standards while positioning boxes will apply the proper semantics, allow all browsers to read your code and any programmer to edit your code.  In addition, avoiding repetition in your code styling will facilitate changes and avoid errors. Standard and consistent use of the <span class="bold">class</span> attribute and CSS Reference will make good practice needed to refine your ability.

These five behaviors will make for perfect practice on your road to fluency!

            Programming languages tell the computer what steps to take.  It is important to understand why new languages are invented for computers in place of English or French, German, etc.  The language of humans is too ambiguous and verbose for a computer to understand.  Like the definition of biweekly; is it every two weeks or twice per week?  A computer needs specific <span class="italic">syntax</span>, clear and concise instructions in order to perform the programmers intended task.

          <p>
            The computer language, <span class="bold">Python</span> , which was named from the Monty Python series, uses Backus-Naur form invented to describe languages simply and concisely.  Like English, Python has <span class="bold">grammar rules</span> similar to sentence structure that can be compared as non-terminals to derive terminals.  For example, the English non-terminal <span class="bold">Sentence: Noun, Verb, Object</span> becomes the terminal: 'I like Python.' Python grammar turns the non-terminal <span class="bold">Expression: Expression, Operator, Expression</span> into the terminal: ((3 * 3) + (2**3)).

          <p>
            Python allows the programmer to use names aka <span class="bold">variables</span> to keep track of numbers via the <span class="bold">Assignment Statement</span>.  Programmers assigning a number or value to a variable is powerful because it makes writing and reading code easier. For example, the speed of light in meters per second is 299792458.  Using an <span class="italic">assignment statement</span> in Python: Name = Expression or speed_of_light = 299792458 will display the actual value of the speed of light when "print speed_of_light is run. The programmer no longer has to remember the value of the speed of light in meters per second.

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            In math, 2+3 <span class="bold">always</span> equals 5. In Python the <span class="bold">=</span> sign means <span class="italic">assignment</span> which means that Python is assigning the expression "5" to a name "variable."  For example, in <span class="bold">my_variable = 5. </span>Python is assigning the "value" 5 to "my_variable." And, because it is a variable, the assignment can be changed. The programmer can make the expression have a different value in the code each time it's evaluated.

            <span class="bold">Strings</span> are a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes: <span class="bold">"I'm a string!"</span> Single or double quotes allowed as long as you open and close with the same type of mark. <span class="bold">'I am a string too!'</span> Strings allow programmers to build search engines and work with any characters they can type on a keyboard.  In Python, the difference between 2+2 and "2" + "2" is the quotes make it a string and the <span class="bold">+</span> sign is an operator that concatonates the two strings.  So, instead of 2+2=4 we have "2"+"2" which is <span class="italic">assigned</span> "22" within the program.

            Functions are tools that programmers can create and reuse forever! Once a programmer has defined a function once, they never have to define it again. An example of avoiding repetition is to use output(s) of one function as input(s) to another; this is called <span class="italic">Composition of Functions.</span>

            <span class="bold">Inheritance</span> is an advanced idea of OOP. Inheritance allows the programmer to create a parent class with instance variables like last_name and eye_color that can be inherited or used by a child class. This child class aka subclass can also have instance variables of its own like number_of_toys; this reuse of code is a huge advantage of OOP that can help the programmer reuse improve the design of existing code.  For example, in the class Movie, instance variables like title and duration and instance methods like def show_trailer() and def get_local_listing() can be extracted and moved into their own class Video file that can be then shared and resued.

          OOP's Advantages and Disadvantages
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            Before OOP, programming was normally seen as a series of logical procedures where the work of these procedures was to take the input and provide the desired output. OOP takes the view that what we really care about are the objects we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. Examples of objects range from human beings (described by name, address, and so forth) to buildings and floors (whose properties can be described and managed) down to the buttons and scroll bars on a computer desktop.
          </p>
          <p>
            OOP is just one more <span class="italic">programming model</span> added to the programming world; it provides many <span class="bold">advantages</span>:
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li>OOP is <span class="bold">modular</span>, as it provides separation of duties in object-based program development.
              </li>
              <li>OOP is <span class="bold">extensible</span>, as objects can be extended to include new attributes and behaviors.
              </li>
              <li>OOP objects can also be <span class="bold">reused</span> within and across applications.
              </li>
            </ol>
          <p>
             Because of these three factors: modularity, extensibility, and reusability, object-oriented programming provides improved software-development productivity over traditional procedure-based programming techniques.  As a result, these three factors can also drive faster and lower cost of development, higher quality and improved maintainability of the software.  Simula was the first object-oriented programming language. Java, Python,  C++,  Visual Basic .NET, Smalltalk, and Ruby are the most popular OOP languages today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies are still using procedure programming in many small and limited time projects. There are problems that lend themselves well to functional or logic programming styles as well and applying OOP in those situations will not result in efficient programs. The <span class="bold">disadvantages</span> are:
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The <span class="bold">thought process</span> involved in OOP may not be natural for some people, and it can take time to get used to it.
              </li>
              <li><span class="bold">Larger program sizes</span> of OOP due to more lines of code over procedural programming.
              </li>
              <li>OOP programs are <span class="bold">slower</span> due to more instructions to be executed.
              </li>
              <li>OOP programs are <span class="bold">not suitable for all</span> applications or problems that need to be solved.

            A <span class="bold">server</span> is a computer or computer program that manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network; its purpose is to handle requests, process them, and deliver responses.  A <span class="italic">web application</span> is a program that generates content and it: lives on a web server; speak the language of Hypertext Protocol Language (HTTP); and generates content that your brownser requests. The content might be <span class="bold">static</span> or <span class="bold">dynamic</span>. Static content consists of a pre-written file or an image.  Dynamic content is created on the fly and consists of your facebook page, a blog's front page or Google search results.

            Your web browser for example, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer etc. sends a <span class="bold">URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</span> to a server and converts HTTP into a <span class="bold">request line</span>.<br>The request line is made up of <span class="bold">method</span>, <span class="bold">path</span>, and <span class="bold">version</span>.
            The server retrieves the<br>information and sends a <span class="bold">response line</span> back to your web browser.<br>The response line is made up of <span class="bold">version</span>, <span class="bold">status code</span>, and <span class="bold">response phrase</span>.
            <br>
            <br>

            The most common methods are <span class="bold">GET</span> and <span class="bold">POST</span>.<br>GET is most often used for requesting a document from the server.  While POST is the<br>common method used to send data to the server. When you make an HTTP <span class="italic">request</span> a number of <span class="bold">Headers</span> formatted as<br>  <span class="code">Name:_value</span> follow the request line. Examples include the <span class="code">HOST: www.example.com</span>. Another is <span class="code">User-Agent: chrome v.17</span>. <br>This is helpful so that the server knows what type of machine is making the request. <br>The differences between GET and POST are in the table to the right:

          The Importance of Validating Input

        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            It is <span class="bold">always</span> important to <span class="bold">validate</span> user input in order to <span class="italic">minimize security risks</span> and <span class="italic">maximize user experience</span>. Programmers might control user input by using dropdown lists and returning error messages; however, the best way to protect the program is by using <span class="bold">Escaping</span>.  <span class="italic">Escaping</span> converts HTML operators like <span class="code">&quot;</span> and <span class="code">&amp;</span>--which, as intentional or unintentional user input, will interfere with the program's behaviour--to <span class="code">escaped</span> HTML formatting. For example, without escaping this input <span class="bold">&lt;html&gt;</span> will not behave as the programmer intended. It might not display as output or it might change the way the webpage loads. If you have html code in your .py file it's best to import the <span class="bold">cgi</span> module which has been specifically designed to handle any intentional or unintentional HTML operator inputs. If you have separate html and .py files, then use the <span class="bold">autoescaping</span> feature included with your templating system.

          HTML Templates and Abstraction
        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            <span class="bold">Templates</span> generally refer to a library referenced to build complicated html strings. One template library built into Google App Engine (GAE) is <span class="bold">jinja2</span>. Templates allow programmers to avoid repetition which is important for all programming. Templates facilitate understanding and enhancing code which makes it easier to code. Using variables, templates and separate html and .py documents in a single folder, the programmer's ability to ehnance their code increases. The importance of using these techniques makes for more secure websites, more readable code, and code that is easier to modify.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following are some techniques that further support Abstraction.<span class="bold"> String substitution</span> allows the programmer to substitute a variable into a string using <span class="code">percent-sign-s</span>;this can be convenient for a few lines of code needed to build a function but can become daunting and confusing when numerous lines of code are needed.<br><span class="bold">Template intheritance</span> lets you define a template to which you can later add new HTML; this is useful when you want to have a consistent header and footer across your entire web application. As your web application evolves, that basic header-footer template may evolve as well without having to repeat the same code throughout several files.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span class="code">magic number</span> concept, supports the standard of using self-defining variables in our code. Numbers are not intuitive and give us very little context as to what they mean and are supposed to do, but if we were to use variables, it gives us a better way to efficiently read and understand code.

          <p>
            <span class="bold">Databases</span> are programs that store and retrieve large amounts of structured data.  A database refers to a program that stores and retrieves data; the machine running that program; and, a group of machines working together to store and retrieve data.

            <span class="bold">Google App Engine (GAE)</span> has an infrastructure that takes care of all the distribution, replication, and load balancing of data behind a simple API (Application Programming Interface). Plus, you get a powerful query engine and transactions as well. GAE's data repository, the <span class="bold">High Replication Datastore (HRD)</span>, uses Paxos algorithm to replicate data across multiple data centers. Data is written to the Datastore in objects known as <span class="bold">entities</span>. Each <span class="italic">entity</span> has a <span class="bold">key</span> that uniquely identifies it.

            The following link: <a href="http://javascript.info/tutorial/adding-script-html#external-scripts">JavaScript Tutorial</a> is where I learned these facts about the power of JS.<span class="bold">JavaScript</span> aka JS is <span class="bold">the</span> programming language used in front end web development because it helps bring web pages to life! JS requires a <span class="italic">SCRIPT</span> tag and a<span class="italic">VAR</span> syntax to delcare variables plus everything in JS is an Object. Script tags can be put anywhare on the page but the most useful places are inside the HEAD tag and at the end right before the closing BODY tag as this aids in proper page rendering. Reminder that only SCRIPT tags are allowed anywhere, CSS styles MUST be placed in the HEAD according to standard. Try the link and practice pulling rabbits out of the hat!

            The following link: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/introduction.html">What is the Document Object Model?</a> is where I learned about another important tool used with JS, <span class="bold">jQuery</span>. jQuery is a common JS library for reading and making changes to the Document Object Model (DOM).  The DOM is a tree that contains information about what is actually visible on the a website. While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the DOM and the DOM can change.  In fact, the power behind JS comes from its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JS object.  When JS makes something interesting happen on a website, it's likely the action happened because JS changed the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but anything it can do, a programmer can do with regular JS code.

            Google Chrome browser commands to open the JS console: <span class="bold">option + command + J</span> will allow the programmer to utilize a really cool debugging feature:<span class="bold">console.log()</span> Accessed via developer tools to debug your code<span class="bold">it is fast and easy</span>.

              <div class="code-block">var awesomeThoughts = "I am Bonnie and I am AWESOME!"<br>
              console.log(awesomeThoughts);<br>
              <br>
              Browser console:<br>
              I am Bonnie and I am AWESOME!<br>

        </div>
        <div class="concept-description" style="display: flex;">
          <p>
            Another JS tool to support Front End web development is <span class="bold">JSON validator:</span> <a href="http://WWW.jsonlint.com">JSONLint.com</a>. JSON validator is used the same way a programmer would utilize the W3C Validation services for HTML or CSS.  Simply copy/paste your JS code into the validator and it will display a code valid message or provide the line number(s) where the mistake should be corrected.
            <br> Though JavaScript has no classes, you can mimic many of the characteristics with its functions. In the illustration to the right the <span class="code">new</span> keyword allows us to create a new instance of an Object. Remember that functions are objects. In the code to the right, you can think of the function <span class="code">Car</span> as a JavaScript version of a Python class definition. Also notice another JS syntax: curly braces.
            </p>
          <div class="concept-description" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;">
              <div class="code-block">function Car() {}<br>
              /*<br>

         <p>
            <br> Another handy tool is <span class="bold">TRUTHY</span> and <span class="bold">FALSY</span>. JS has a set of values that may evaluate to True or False but may not equal True or False. Truthy examples: true, non-zero numbers, strings, objects, arrays and functions.  Falsy examples: false, zero, empty string, undefined, null and NAN (not a number) like zero divided by zero.
            <br>
            <br>A handy tool to help you remember the differences between TRUTHY and FALSY are in the table to the right:

            <span class="bold">JavaScript Basics</span> is the free Udacity course where I learned to use JS to build my resume. Click this link and get started building your resume. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud804/l-1946788554/m-1923698634">JavaScript Basics</a>. I learned how to in create and append arrays using the VAR syntax. Arrays in JS are zero index and the syntax looks like this:<br>
            <br>var myArray = [item1, item2, item3]
            <br>
            <br>
            I also learned how to access properties in and about the array using JS syntax. For example, in myArray above (myArray.length) is equal to 3; however, the last index is 2: item1 is position 0, item2 position 1 and item3 position 2. Another key learning is JavaScript Basics is <span class="bold">encapsulation</span>. Since everything is an object in JS denoted by the curly braces, objects can encapsulate functions. For example, I learned how to create "display" as a method of the objects: Projects, Work, Education. These objects already contain all the pertinent data about me. The code includes a function to help display the content of the objects using dot notation. This may sound crazy but I found learning JavaScript Basics easy!  I dont know if it seems easy because I already know some Python or if it really is simple to understand--maybe it's just FUN!
